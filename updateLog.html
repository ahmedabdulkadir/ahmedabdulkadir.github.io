            <p>Hello there! I'm still trying to figure this out how this works.</p>
            <p>For now it is a simple page, but over the next few days/weeks I am hoping to set up something professional. 
            Hopefully the next time you look at this you will go like "wow this is some good ass shit".</p>

            <p>Over the past 12 hours (since the last update) I added a background, changed fonts and styles, added an extra link and connected the /about page to Wordpress. Good progress. </p>

            <p>Fresh new site has been made. Used a template online. I liked when I did it on my own, but some things take too long to code on my own. The other one is pretty nice though. </p>
